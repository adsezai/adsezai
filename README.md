### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Adis Sezairi

I am a Software Engineer based in Ulm, Germany.

I build Backend Microservices with Node.js and sometimes Frondend stuff with mostly React.

I have gained experience with the following technologies. 

`javascript` `typescript` `Node.js` `React` `Docker` `Traefik` `Next.js` `Mongo` `Express` `typescript` `Git` `Linux` `Electron` `HTML` `CSS`

ðŸ¤“ I am always interested in trying new technology. Currently I am lerning Golang as well as functional programming.

I am also learning about algorithms and data structures to make my code fast.ðŸš€âš¡
